STOCK_ENDPOINT = "https://www.alphavantage.co/query"
NEWS_ENDPOINT = "https://newsapi.org/v2/everything"

alpha_vantage_api = '0932AKBUWY8FBQC7'

## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co/query
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price. 

# Set the parameters for the API call to alphavantage
alpha_parameters = {
    "function": 'TIME_SERIES_DAILY',
    "symbol": STOCK,
    "exclude": 'current,minutely,daily',
    "apikey": alpha_vantage_api
}

# Do the API call to alphavantge
response_alpha = requests.get(url=STOCK_ENDPOINT, params=alpha_parameters)
response_alpha.raise_for_status()

# convert the API response to JSON format
data_alpha = response_alpha.json()

def latest_business_day(check_day):
    # check if the check_day argument is a weekday and if not, roll back to previous business day (Mon - Fri)
    if date.weekday(check_day) == 5:      #if it's Saturday
        check_day = check_day - timedelta(days = 1) #then make it Friday
    elif date.weekday(check_day) == 6:      #if it's Sunday
        check_day = check_day - timedelta(days = 2); #then make it Friday
    return check_day

# Pass today - 1 day to latest_business_day to check if it's a business day. The - 1 is because often RSA today is ahead of closing in USA
this_day = dt.today() - timedelta(days = 1)
lastBusDay = latest_business_day(this_day)
# Pass yesterday to latest_business_day to check if it's a business day.
previousDay = latest_business_day(lastBusDay) - timedelta(days = 1)
# Convert days to string date format to check the JSON dictionary
lastBusDate = lastBusDay.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
previousDate = previousDay.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

# Get the closing prices for today and yesterday
today_price = float(data_alpha['Time Series (Daily)'][lastBusDate]['4. close'])
yesterday_price = float(data_alpha['Time Series (Daily)'][previousDate]['4. close'])

# check the percentage change between yesterday to today
price_difference = abs(today_price - yesterday_price)
percent_change = 100 * price_difference / yesterday_price

if percent_change > 5:
    print("Get news")


## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator


# Set the parameters for the API call to NewsAPI
news_parameters = {
    "key": 'value',   
}

# Do the API call to NewsAPI
response_news = requests.get(url=NEWS_ENDPOINT, params=news_parameters)
response_news.raise_for_status()

# Convert the API response to JSON format
data_news = response_news.json()

## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
#HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.



#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
