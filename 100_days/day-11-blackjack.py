## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.

from random import randint

cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]

    delt_card = cards[randint(0, len(cards) - 1)]
    return delt_card

user_cards = []
dealer_cards = []

i = 0

while i <= 1:
    user_cards.append(deal_card())
    dealer_cards.append(deal_card())
    i += 1

def card_check(user_cards, dealer_cards):
    user_score = user_cards[0] + user_cards[1]
    dealer_score = dealer_cards[0] + dealer_cards[1]

    print(f"User cards: {user_cards} User score: {user_score}")
    print(f"Dealer cards: {dealer_cards} User score: {dealer_score}")

    if user_score == 21 and dealer_score == 21:
        print("The user and the dealer has blackjack. Game drawn")
    elif user_score == 21 and dealer_score == 21:
        print("The user has wone with blackjack.")
    elif dealer_score == 21:
        print("The user has lost, dealer has blackjack")

    if user_score > 21:
        while test_card in user_cards == 11:
            user_cards[test_card] = 1
