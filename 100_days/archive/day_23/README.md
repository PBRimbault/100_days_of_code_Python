The Turtle Crossing Capstone Project - Day 23

Step 1
    Create the turtle play that moves from y = -280 to y = 280
    Use the 'Up' key and onkeypress function to move

Step 2
    Create cars that are 20px high by 40px wide that are randomly generated along the y-axis and move to the left edge of the screen. No cars should be generated in the top and bottom 50px of the screen (think of it as a safe zone for our little turtle). Hint: generate a new car only every 6th time the game loop runs. 

Step 3
    Detect when the turtle player collides with a car and stop the game if this happens
